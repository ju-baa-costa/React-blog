#React website
This is the outcome of the Net Ninja's "Full Modern React Tutorial".

#The challenge:
This website's goal is to be able to create, read and delete blogs, along with choosing wich author will be credited for the post.

#Technologies used:
In this project, I used React, JavaScript, vanilla CSS for styling, and JSON Server to simulate a RESTful API.

#What I learned:
As planned, with this application I got familiar with React's syntax, good practices and the overall structure of websites in this library.
